# Game Room

This is a simple game room website where users can create rooms, join rooms, and play a game until a single winner is left.

## How to Play

1. Create a game by choosing between "close" and "far", the number of players, the names of the players, and the factor by which the average is multiplied.
2. Join a room and wait for 1.5 minutes for the game to start.
3. The game will iterate until a single winner is left.
4. The winner is declared, and you can exit the room.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

2. Go to the repository settings.
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`).
5. Click "Save".
6. Your site will be live at the provided URL.
